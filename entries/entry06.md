# What did I learn from this year long project?

It was really interesting to learn about APIs and how it allowed the frontend and backend to communicate. In this case, the frontend is the application that I made, and firebase is the backend. I have used my knowledge of arrays and objects to make a social media app that also tracks the time of upload. Using the DOM (Document Object Model) helped me dynamically upload the website to the user's will. There are a lot of skills that I should take away from this project. I should start commenting my code, and I should also start try optimizing my code. I needed to use loops so that I can initialize the website. I have learned that I needed all of the basics to create anything.

Well, to start learning Firebase, I used the Firebase documentations. But after a while I realized that the firebase were quite confusing. I've got the authentication working at first, but I didn't know what to do from there. That's when I decided to hit up YouTube. I found a channel called ["The Net Ninja"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1LnNq4z54&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ) and his videos were super helpful. He had a mini-project-esque tutorial series that walks you through making a website that people can log on and off. This was probably the best way to learn Firebase in my opinion, instead of giving you options on what you can do, they should just give you 1 option and let you follow that to understand exactly how it works.
