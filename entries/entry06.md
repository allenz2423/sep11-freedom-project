# Takeaways from the Expo Elevator Pitch and In-class Presentation

My Expo elevator pitch was pretty mediocre. I had a script, but I wasn't able to utilize it. I've learned that it was way easier to improvise on the spot than to rehearse. I probably could've done better if I woke up a bit earlier, and there was some pressure when presenting to the judges. There felt like a time crunch. I didn't feel a time crunch when presenting in-class though, as I didn't have much to show, and I didn't really know what to show. I thought perhaps it would be more entertaining to explain how my code works, but that turned out to bore everyone. Next time, I should spend more time actually demonstrating my product, and my product should've had more features.

Well, to start learning Firebase, I used the Firebase documentations. But after a while I realized that the firebase were quite confusing. I've got the authentication working at first, but I didn't know what to do from there. That's when I decided to hit up YouTube. I found a channel called ["The Net Ninja"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1LnNq4z54&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ) and his videos were super helpful. He had a mini-project-esque tutorial series that walks you through making a website that people can log on and off. This was probably the best way to learn Firebase in my opinion, instead of giving you options on what you can do, they should just give you 1 option and let you follow that to understand exactly how it works.

# EDP (Engineering Development Process)

The stage of the EDP I'm on is <b>Improve</b>. I am already done with a MVP, and everything works. What I should do next is improve on the design, make the loading a bit faster, and make the website more user friendly. After I am done improving, I should move on to communicating the results although I am not sure if I would need to do that at all. The thing with the current step of the EDP is that I don't really want to improve on the product that would be the MVP. I want to improve on the design. I want to make the loading a bit faster. I want to make the website more user friendly. But do I actually want to do that? All the meaningful changes I can make to the website will not be noticed by the end user. The end user will not notice the slightly faster loading time, they won't notice the more secure deletion system. I hate front end design work. 

# Skills

The skills I've used for this project are: <ul><li>Thinking like a computer
<ul><li>Deleting the entries required me to understand what a computer reads and how it reads off an array.</li><li>Loading the entries required me to think about how a computer reads things. This led me to use a forEach loop.</li>
<li>Keeping the user logged in was kind of self explanatory. I just checked their authentication status, if it is then it redirects them to the main page, vice versa.</li></ul>
</ul>
<ul><li>Reading the Documentations</li></ul>
<ul><li>Googling and asking for help when I need it</li></ul>
<ul><li>Communicating with the backend</li></ul>
<ul><li>Using the DOM</li></ul>
</li></ul>

I believe being able to Google is the most important skill I have. It allows me to solve the issues I have by searching it up. It doesn't bother anyone, and the skills are already posted on the web.
