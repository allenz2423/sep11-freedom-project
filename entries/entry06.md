# What did I learn from this year long project?

It was really interesting to learn about APIs and how it allowed the frontend and backend to communicate. In this case, the frontend is the application that I made, and firebase is the backend. I have used my knowledge of arrays and objects to make a social media app that also tracks the time of upload. Using the DOM (Document Object Model) helped me dynamically upload the website to the user's will. There are a lot of skills that I should take away from this project. I should start commenting my code, and I should also start try optimizing my code. I needed to use loops so that I can initialize the website. I have learned that I needed all of the basics to create anything.

# Sources

Well, to start learning Firebase, I used the Firebase documentations. But after a while I realized that the firebase were quite confusing. I've got the authentication working at first, but I didn't know what to do from there. That's when I decided to hit up YouTube. I found a channel called ["The Net Ninja"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1LnNq4z54&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ) and his videos were super helpful. He had a mini-project-esque tutorial series that walks you through making a website that people can log on and off. This was probably the best way to learn Firebase in my opinion, instead of giving you options on what you can do, they should just give you 1 option and let you follow that to understand exactly how it works.

# EDP (Engineering Development Process)

The stage of the EDP I'm on is <b>Improve</b>. I am already done with a MVP, and everything works. What I should do next is improve on the design, make the loading a bit faster, and make the website more user friendly. After I am done improving, I should move on to communicating the results although I am not sure if I would need to do that at all. The thing with the current step of the EDP is that I don't really want to improve on the product that would be the MVP. I want to improve on the design. I want to make the loading a bit faster. I want to make the website more user friendly. But do I actually want to do that? All the meaningful changes I can make to the website will not be noticed by the end user. The end user will not notice the slightly faster loading time, they won't notice the more secure deletion system. I hate front end design work. 

# Skills

The skills I've used for this project are: <li>Thinking like a computer
<ul><li>Deleting the entries required me to understand what a computer reads and how it reads off an array.</li><li>Loading the entries required me to think about how a computer reads things. This led me to use a forEach loop.</li>
<li>Keeping the user logged in was kind of self explanatory. I just checked their authentication status, if it is then it redirects them to the main page, vice versa.</li></ul>
</ul>
<li>Reading the Documentations</li>
<li>Googling and asking for help when I need it</li>
<li>Communicating with the backend</li>
<li>Using the DOM</li>
</li>

I believe being able to Google is the most important skill I have. It allows me to solve the issues I have by searching it up. It doesn't bother anyone, and the skills are already posted on the web.
